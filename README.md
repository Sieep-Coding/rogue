# Roguelike (Name: TBD)

![Todo List](https://github.com/Sieep-Coding/rouge/blob/main/todo.md)

A simple unnamed *roguelike* game built using **C++** and **Raylib**. 

The game features a player-controlled blob that moves in a bird's-eye perspective, swings a sword to defeat enemies, and progresses through procedurally generated rooms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC or any modern C++ compiler.
- **Raylib**: Installed on your system. [Raylib Installation Guide](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#installation).
- **CMake**: To build the project.

## Controls

- **Movement**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` to move the blob.
- **Sword Swing**: Aim with the mouse and click the `left mouse button` to swing the sword.


## Planned Features

- Procedurally generated room transitions.
- Health system for the player and enemies.
- Level up, find items for buffs.
- Advanced enemy behaviors and encounters.
- Improved graphics and sound effects.
- Handwritten soundtrack by me.
